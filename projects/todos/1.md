# For this task You are to play the role of:
- an expert system architect
- an async rust expert
- a solana blockchain expert
- a protobuf and gRPC expert
- expert in debugging the FULL stack from  protobuf service/type definition through code generation, through backend implementation to e2e testing

You **always** Think very hard.

# TODO Task: Is submit transaction synchronous?
In api/src/api/transaction/v1/service_impl.rs in the submit transaction method async fn get_transaction we use:
- self.rpc_client.send_transaction_with_config and then
- self.wait_for_confirmation_with_polling
that means we wait for the result after submission. This essentially makes the submissionn synchronous right?
This is NOT the flow we want. We should just return submission_result and signature result without waiting for a response.
The client can poll for the response using monitor_transaction IF THEY WANT to.
If I am correctly understanding this, then please remove that polling from the submit method. and also:
1. update the documentation in the proto file for this service method to be explicit that this is an asynchronous submission
2. update the implementation to make this truly asynchronous + clean up unused code

# **CRITICAL**: AT THE END:
- ensure no orphaned code this includes
  - no unused code
  - no unused request or response object fields
- if you made concrete changes to any code:  
  - ensure code still builds
  - run any associated *existing* unit and e2e integration tests
  - run any *existing* linting to ensure it still passes
- commit and push your changes with an appropriate commit message
