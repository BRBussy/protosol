# TODO Task: abstract and test generic utilities
This file: api/src/api/program/system/v1/conversion.rs, is located inside the system program api implementation.
It contains some useful generic conversion functions that would be relevant for any other solana program api wrapper.

Your task:
Abstract this out to another location in api/src so that they can be resused across multiple apis in api/src/api in future.

# **CRITICAL**: AT THE END:
- ensure no orphaned code this includes
  - no unused code
  - no unused request or response object fields
- if you made concrete changes to any code:  
  - ensure code still builds
  - run any associated *existing* unit and e2e integration tests
  - run any *existing* linting to ensure it still passes
- **MOST IMPORTANT**:
  - Do a comprehensive self code review of all the changes you made
  - be critical, confirm that the changes you have made follow best practices
  - go back and read the this task again, confirm that you have achieved all changes
- commit and push your changes with an appropriate commit message
