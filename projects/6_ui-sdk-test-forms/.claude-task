# ProtoSol UI Dashboard Project Task

## Task Overview
Implement a comprehensive Next.js dashboard for testing and interacting with all ProtoSol gRPC APIs. The implementation includes transaction construction, compilation, signing, and submission with full lifecycle support.

## Quick Start Instructions
When resuming this task:
1. Check Progress Log below to see current status
2. Verify actual state matches progress (files exist, builds work)
3. Continue from the next pending step

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Complete sidebar navigation dashboard
- ✅ All ProtoSol services accessible via UI
- ✅ Full transaction lifecycle (draft → compile → sign → submit)
- ✅ Program services integration for instruction building
- ✅ TypeScript SDK properly exported and integrated

## Context Management
- Take breaks after 2 major steps to prevent context overflow
- Always update progress before requesting context reset
- Use "carry on with this task implementation-plan and take a look at the progress.md to see where you got up to" to resume
