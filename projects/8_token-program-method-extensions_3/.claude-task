## Progress Log
### 2025-08-31 21:19:00
- Started project execution
- Created .claude-task file
- Next: Step 1 - Define Mint Proto Service Method
- Status: Starting

### 2025-08-31 21:23:00
- Completed Step 1: Added Mint RPC method and MintRequest/MintResponse messages to service.proto
- Completed Step 2: Validated proto with buf lint, generated all SDKs successfully
- Generated files verified in Rust, Go, and TypeScript SDKs
- Mint method properly generated in all language bindings
- Next: Step 3 - Implement Rust Backend Service
- Status: In Progress

### 2025-08-31 21:27:00
- Completed Step 3: Added mint method implementation to Rust backend service
- Added imports for MintRequest, MintResponse, and mint_to_checked function
- Implemented mint method with proper error handling and validation
- Rust linting passed successfully
- Backend compilation successful - mint method ready for testing
- Next: Step 4 - Add E2E Tests for Mint Functionality
- Status: In Progress

### 2025-08-31 21:32:00
- Completed Step 4: Extended Test_03_Token_e2e with mint functionality
- Added mint instruction creation using new Mint service method
- Created separate mint transaction with proper signing (mint authority only)
- Added verification of mint supply increase after minting
- Enhanced blockchain verification commands including spl-token
- Go test compilation successful - all syntax verified
- Next: Step 5 - Run Integration Tests
- Status: In Progress

### 2025-08-31 21:35:00
- Completed Step 5: Successfully ran integration tests
- Rebuilt and restarted backend with mint method implementation
- Integration test passed completely: Test_03_Token_e2e (58.66s)
- Successfully minted 1,000,000 tokens to holding account
- Verified mint supply increased from 0 to 1,000,000 as expected
- All blockchain verification commands working
- Status: COMPLETE ✅

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Proto service method added for Mint
- ✅ Code generation successful 
- ✅ Rust backend implementation complete
- ✅ E2E tests passing
- ✅ All linting clean (Rust passed, some TS/Go config issues not related to implementation)
- ✅ Full transaction lifecycle verified
- ✅ Integration test demonstrates complete mint flow: account creation → token account creation → minting → verification
- ✅ Mint method properly wraps spl-token-2022's MintToChecked instruction
- ✅ Real blockchain verification: 1,000,000 tokens successfully minted and verified

## Validation Commands
```bash
buf lint lib/proto
./scripts/code-gen/generate/all.sh
cargo build
./scripts/lint/all.sh
cd tests/go && go test -v -run "TestTokenProgramSuite"
```
