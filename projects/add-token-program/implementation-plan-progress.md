# Implementation Progress Log

## 2025-08-31 14:40:00
- Starting Token Program Wrapper implementation
- Created initial progress file
- Status: Beginning Step 0 - System Program Owner Parameter Fix (PREREQUISITE)
- Next: Modify system program proto to add owner field to CreateRequest
- Notes: This step is required before implementing token program as tests need owner parameter support

## 2025-08-31 15:00:00
- COMPLETED Step 0: System Program Owner Parameter Fix (PREREQUISITE)
- ✅ Modified proto: Added owner field to CreateRequest with field number 3
- ✅ Updated Rust implementation: Handles owner parameter, defaults to system program when empty
- ✅ Updated all tests: Both Rust and Go tests now provide owner parameter
- ✅ Code generation successful: All SDKs generated without errors  
- ✅ Validation complete: Rust compiles, Go SDK compiles, tests pass
- Status: Ready to proceed to Step 1 - Token Program Implementation
- Next: Begin implementing token program proto service definitions

## 2025-08-31 15:10:00
- COMPLETED Step 1: Define Token Program gRPC Service and Messages
- ✅ Created proto: lib/proto/protosol/solana/program/token/v1/service.proto with 3 RPC methods
- ✅ Created constants: lib/go/protosol/solana/program/token/v1/consts.go with Token 2022 constants
- ✅ Pre-review validations passed: Path structure, imports, naming conventions
- ✅ Code generation successful: All SDKs generated without errors
- ✅ Compilation verified: Both Rust and Go build successfully
- Status: Ready to proceed to Step 2 - Rust Token Program Service Implementation  
- Next: Implement TokenProgramServiceImpl in Rust with 3 methods

## 2025-08-31 15:25:00
- COMPLETED Step 2: Implement Rust Token Program Service
- ✅ Added dependency: spl-token-2022 = "3.0.0" to Cargo.toml
- ✅ Created service implementation: api/src/api/program/token/v1/service_impl.rs with all 3 RPC methods
- ✅ Created API wrapper: api/src/api/program/token/v1/token_v1_api.rs with dependency injection
- ✅ Updated module structure: Created mod.rs files and updated program manager
- ✅ Updated main.rs: Added token program service to gRPC server setup
- ✅ Fixed protobuf bindings: Added token module to lib/rust/src/lib.rs
- ✅ Validation complete: Cargo build successful, linting clean (with minor casting warning)
- Status: Ready to proceed to Step 3 - Token Program E2E Testing
- Next: Create and implement integration tests for token program functionality
