# Claude Task Configuration
# Task: Implement Token Program Wrapper

## Task Metadata
name: implement-token-program-wrapper
type: implementation
priority: high
estimated_effort: 4-8 hours
can_be_resumed: true
requires_context_management: true

## Task Description
Implement a gRPC service wrapper for Solana Token 2022 program operations, starting with InitialiseMint instruction. Includes prerequisite system program owner parameter fix and comprehensive integration testing.

## Entry Points
primary_document: implementation-plan.md
requirements_doc: prompt.md
command_file: n/a

## Quick Start
When directed here via `/execute-project projects/add-token-program`:
1. Read implementation-plan.md
2. Check Progress Log section in this .claude-task file
3. Execute from current step (start with Step 0 - system program prerequisite)
4. Update Progress Log section frequently

## Immediate Response
```
I'll implement the Token Program wrapper for Token 2022 InitialiseMint instruction.

This requires a prerequisite fix to the system program to accept owner parameter, then implementing the token program service with mint creation, rent calculation, and account parsing.

Starting by checking the implementation plan and current progress...
```

## Context Management
max_steps_per_session: 2
auto_save_progress: true
clear_context_after_steps: 2

## Required Tools
- Read (for checking existing files)
- Write (for creating new files)  
- Edit (for modifying existing files)
- Bash (for running commands)
- TodoWrite (for tracking subtasks)

## Validation Commands
- buf lint (validate proto)
- ./scripts/code-gen/generate/all.sh (generate code)
- cargo build (validate Rust compilation)
- go test -v -run TestTokenProgramE2ESuite (validate implementation)
- ./scripts/lint/all.sh (validate code quality)

## Error Recovery
on_error: 
  - Update Progress Log section with error details
  - Attempt to diagnose the issue
  - If blocked, document the blockage and request human assistance

## Completion Criteria
- All 5 steps in implementation-plan.md completed (Step 0 + Steps 1-4)
- System program owner parameter fix working
- Token program service implemented with all 3 methods
- All integration tests passing (existing + new token tests)
- Linting clean
- Progress Log shows all steps complete

## Notes for Claude
- This is a REAL implementation task, not a simulation
- Follow the implementation plan EXACTLY
- Use pre-review requirements as guardrails
- Update Progress Log section frequently
- Quality over speed - take breaks if needed
- Never fake or simulate implementation
- Step 0 (system program fix) is a prerequisite for token program tests

## Special Instructions
CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES:
1. Step 0 must be completed first (system program owner parameter)
2. System program tests must pass before proceeding to token implementation
3. Token program uses Token 2022 program ID for all operations
4. Integration test must create real blockchain transactions and verify results
