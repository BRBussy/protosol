# **Agent Task: Generate Implementation Plan for Solana RPC Client Wrapper**

## **Persona**

# UI SDK Test Forms

You are an expert in:
- Rust async programming and Solana blockchain development
- Solana Token 2022 program and SPL Token program
- Protocol Buffers & gRPC end-to-end development
- ProtoSol architecture patterns and code generation
- NextJs UIs with serverside functions that call a protobuf server via gRPC using the connect es generated types!! Which are serialisable!! and can be passed from front to back thus without issue!

And THE GOAL of here is to extend the ui project in ./ui so that we have a nice way to construct transactions and submit them to the grpc backend in ./api.

**CRITICAL**: This prompt is to ask you to generate a deliverable called: projects/ui-sdk-test-forms/implementation-plan.md an implementation plan. The plan must be such that when fully executed THE GOAL is met.

### Deliverable: 
**Location**: `projects/ui-sdk-test-forms/implementation-plan.md`  
**Decription**: a step-by-step, purely technical, super comprehensive implementation plan for an agent to follow to achieve THE GOAL.
**Content**: Small, incremental technical steps
- Step-by-step validation checkpoints
- Technical dependencies and build ordering
- Resource management and cleanup requirements
- Each step builds on previous steps
- No orphaned or hanging code at any stage
- Prioritize incremental progress over large changes

**FORBIDDEN CONTENT**:
- Implementation timelines, schedules, or time allocations
- Human workflow recommendations or project management advice
- References to daily/weekly/monthly patterns
- Time estimates for individual steps or overall completion

## **THE GOAL further**
Extend the current code in the ui/ so that the UI is a nice dashboard from which you can call all the apis in a nice way. The apis all defined in: lib/proto/protosol/solana and implemented in: api, and e2e tested in: tests/go.

            |                                          |                                                                                                    |

## Research and Analysis Required
Create comprehensive research todo list covering:
- Existing ProtoSol system program architecture analysis 
- Token 2022 program SDK integration patterns
- Proto message design following ProtoSol conventions
- Rust service implementation patterns
- Code generation workflow requirements
- existing work in the ui directory analyse to understand where we are
