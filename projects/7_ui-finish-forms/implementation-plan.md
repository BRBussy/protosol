# ProtoSol UI Forms Completion Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan completes the missing dynamic parameter forms for program methods in the existing UI transaction form. Currently, the UI shows placeholder text "This section would contain the dynamic parameter forms for the selected program method" instead of actual working forms. This implementation will finish that functionality to achieve complete transaction construction capability.

## Goals
- Complete the dynamic parameter forms for all System Program methods
- Complete the dynamic parameter forms for all Token Program methods  
- Enable full instruction construction and transaction building through the UI
- Ensure all parameter fields are properly validated and functional
- Maintain the existing transaction state machine workflow

## CRITICAL: Context Management, Progress and Quality
Some critical information for the implemenation agent.

### Important Notice to Implementation Agent on Step Comletion

**You DO NOT need to complete all steps in one session.** There is NO requirement to fit everything in a single context window. This implementation can and should be done methodically, with breaks and context resets as needed.

### On Progress Tracking

1. **Create Progress File**: Before starting implementation, create/update your progress task tracking file .claude-task in the same directory as this plan
2. **Update Progress**: After completing each step or substep, update the progress file with:
   - Timestamp
   - Step completed
   - Any important findings or deviations
   - Next step to tackle
3. **Context Reset Protocol**: If you need to clear context or feel overwhelmed:
   - Update progress file with current state
   - Note any pending work
   - When resuming, use the magic phrase: "carry on with this task implementation-plan and take a look at the progress.md to see where you got up to"
4. **Eventually Consistent**: The progress file is eventually consistent - you may have progressed further than the last entry. Always verify the actual state before continuing (only relevant on RESTARTING TASK).

### On Quality Over Speed

**NEVER** simulate or fake implementation. If you find yourself writing comments like "simulating token mint creation" instead of actual code, STOP immediately, update the progress file, and request a context reset.

## Phase 1: Service Configuration Completion

### Step 1.1: Complete System Program Service Configuration
**Objective**: Add all missing System Program methods to service configuration

**Pre-review Note**: This step involves updating the service configuration file to match the full protobuf definition. The service configuration determines which methods appear in the UI dropdowns.

**Actions**:
1. Update `ui/src/lib/service-configs.ts` System Program configuration
2. Add missing methods from proto file:
   - `allocate` (AllocateRequest)
   - `assign` (AssignRequest)
   - `createWithSeed` (CreateWithSeedRequest)
   - `allocateWithSeed` (AllocateWithSeedRequest)
   - `assignWithSeed` (AssignWithSeedRequest)
   - `transferWithSeed` (TransferWithSeedRequest)
   - `initializeNonceAccount` (InitializeNonceAccountRequest)
   - `authorizeNonceAccount` (AuthorizeNonceAccountRequest)
   - `withdrawNonceAccount` (WithdrawNonceAccountRequest)
   - `advanceNonceAccount` (AdvanceNonceAccountRequest)
   - `upgradeNonceAccount` (UpgradeNonceAccountRequest)
3. For each method, define parameters matching proto field definitions exactly
4. Include proper field types (string, bigint, boolean) and validation requirements
5. Add helpful descriptions and placeholders for each parameter

**Validation**: UI method dropdown shows all 12 System Program methods with proper parameter definitions

---

### Step 1.2: Complete Token Program Service Configuration  
**Objective**: Add all missing Token Program methods to service configuration

**Pre-review Note**: The current Token Program config only has `initialiseMint`. The proto file shows 6 methods available. Each method has different parameter requirements that must be captured accurately.

**Actions**:
1. Update `ui/src/lib/service-configs.ts` Token Program configuration
2. Add missing methods from proto file:
   - `getCurrentMinRentForTokenAccount` (no parameters)
   - `parseMint` (ParseMintRequest)
   - `initialiseHoldingAccount` (InitialiseHoldingAccountRequest)  
   - `getCurrentMinRentForHoldingAccount` (no parameters)
   - `createMint` (CreateMintRequest)
   - `createHoldingAccount` (CreateHoldingAccountRequest)
3. Define parameters for each method matching proto exactly
4. Handle methods that return multiple instructions (createMint, createHoldingAccount)
5. Add validation rules for token-specific fields (decimals 0-9, etc.)

**Validation**: UI method dropdown shows all 6 Token Program methods with complete parameter definitions

---

## Phase 2: Dynamic Form Component Implementation

### Step 2.1: Create Universal Parameter Form Component
**Objective**: Build reusable component for rendering method parameters dynamically

**Pre-review Note**: This is a critical component that will render different input types based on parameter configuration. It must handle all parameter types defined in service configs (string, bigint, number, enum, boolean).

**Actions**:
1. Create `ui/src/components/ParameterForm.tsx`
2. Implement dynamic rendering based on parameter type:
   - `string`: Text input with validation
   - `bigint`: Number input with bigint handling
   - `number`: Number input with proper validation
   - `enum`: Select dropdown with options
   - `boolean`: Checkbox input
3. Add validation logic for each input type:
   - Base58 address validation for address fields
   - Number range validation
   - Required field validation
4. Implement form state management using React useState
5. Add error display and success feedback
6. Include copy/paste functionality for address fields
7. Add placeholders and help text from service config

**Key Implementation Requirements**:
- Must handle nested parameter objects
- Must support optional vs required field distinction
- Must provide clear validation feedback
- Must be completely reusable across all services

**Validation**: Component can render forms for any service method configuration and collect valid parameters

---

### Step 2.2: Create Server Actions for Program Method Calls
**Objective**: Implement backend integration for all program service methods

**Pre-review Note**: These server actions will be called from the dynamic forms. Each action must properly call the correct gRPC service method and return a SolanaInstruction that can be added to the transaction.

**Actions**:
1. Create `ui/src/lib/actions/system-program-actions.ts`
2. Implement server actions for all System Program methods:
   - `createAccountAction` (calls system.create)
   - `transferAction` (calls system.transfer)
   - `allocateAction` (calls system.allocate)
   - `assignAction` (calls system.assign)
   - `createWithSeedAction` (calls system.createWithSeed)
   - And all remaining methods...
3. Create `ui/src/lib/actions/token-program-actions.ts`  
4. Implement server actions for all Token Program methods:
   - `initialiseMintAction` (calls token.initialiseMint)
   - `createMintAction` (calls token.createMint - returns multiple instructions)
   - `initialiseHoldingAccountAction` (calls token.initialiseHoldingAccount)
   - And all remaining methods...
5. Each action must:
   - Accept FormData with method parameters
   - Validate parameters before gRPC call
   - Call appropriate gRPC service method
   - Handle gRPC errors gracefully
   - Return SolanaInstruction(s) or error messages
   - Support methods that return multiple instructions

**Critical Implementation Details**:
- Handle parameter type conversion (string to bigint, etc.)
- Implement proper error handling for gRPC failures
- Support methods that return arrays of instructions
- Validate addresses and numeric inputs server-side

**Validation**: All program method server actions work correctly and return proper instructions

## Phase 3: Transaction Form Integration

### Step 3.1: Replace Placeholder with Dynamic Forms
**Objective**: Replace the placeholder text with working dynamic parameter forms

**Pre-review Note**: This directly addresses the main gap mentioned in the prompt. The existing code at line 836-844 in `page.tsx` must be completely replaced with functional form rendering.

**Actions**:
1. Update `ui/src/app/solana/transaction/v1/page.tsx`
2. Remove placeholder section (lines 836-844) that shows "This section would contain the dynamic parameter forms"
3. Import and integrate ParameterForm component
4. Add dynamic form rendering based on selectedMethod:
   ```typescript
   {selectedMethod && (
     <ParameterForm
       method={selectedMethod}
       onSubmit={handleParameterSubmit}
       loading={addInstructionLoading}
     />
   )}
   ```
5. Implement `handleParameterSubmit` function:
   - Call appropriate server action based on selected program/method
   - Add returned instruction(s) to currentTransaction.instructions
   - Update UI to show newly added instructions
   - Clear form after successful addition
   - Handle errors and display feedback
6. Add loading states during instruction creation
7. Add success feedback when instructions are added
8. Update instruction display to show newly added instructions with details

**Key Integration Points**:
- Must work with existing program/method selection logic
- Must integrate with existing transaction state management
- Must provide clear feedback on instruction addition
- Must handle both single and multiple instruction responses

**Validation**: Can select any program method, fill out parameters, and successfully add instructions to draft transaction

---

### Step 3.2: Add Instruction Management Features
**Objective**: Enable instruction editing, removal, and reordering

**Pre-review Note**: Users may need to modify or remove instructions after adding them. This step adds those capabilities while maintaining transaction state integrity.

**Actions**:
1. Add "Remove Instruction" buttons to instruction list in transaction display
2. Implement instruction removal logic that updates transaction state
3. Add instruction reordering capability (drag & drop or up/down buttons)
4. Add "Edit Instruction" functionality:
   - Pre-populate form with instruction parameters
   - Allow parameter modification
   - Replace instruction in transaction when saved
5. Add "Duplicate Instruction" feature for similar instructions
6. Add instruction validation:
   - Check for conflicting instructions
   - Validate account usage across instructions
   - Warn about potential issues
7. Add instruction details expansion:
   - Show program ID, accounts, and data
   - Display human-readable instruction description
   - Show instruction size and fee impact

**Advanced Features**:
- Instruction templates for common operations
- Batch instruction operations
- Instruction dependency validation

**Validation**: Can fully manage instruction list (add, edit, remove, reorder) while maintaining transaction integrity
